	<h1>Self quiz library</h1>
	<p>This javascript library will build a "test your knowledge" style quiz based on a specific pattern of HTML markup.</p>
	<p>The following questions show the various types of questions that are possible.</p>
	<div class="selfquiz">
		<h2>Single correct answer</h2>
		<p>This type of multiple-choice question presumes that the learner will need to choose one correct option from among multiple choices. This type of question should be marked up as follows. Note the class and data attributes being used to declare question type and correct answers...</p>
<code><pre>&lt;div class="question">
	&lt;div class="prompt">Why did the chicken cross the road?&lt;/div>
	&lt;ul class="answers" data-questiontype="radio">
		&lt;li>Fleeing the effects of climate change&lt;/li>
		&lt;li data-status="correct">To get to the other side&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>There was a sale at Macy's&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
	&lt;div class="feedback">The feedback block can be used to provide additional information after the quiz has been evaluated.&lt;/div>
&lt;/div></pre></code>
		<div class="question">
			<div class="prompt">1. Who was the first world leader to send an email?</div>
			<ul class="answers" data-questiontype="radio">
				<li>Al Gore</li>
				<li data-status="correct">Queen Elizabeth II</li>
				<li>Margaret Thatcher</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="feedback">Remember, according to biased reporting, Al Gore invented the Internet! We were unable to confirm that Margaret Thatcher ever used email.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<div class="prompt">2. Which image format was introduced first?</div>
			<ul class="answers" data-questiontype="radio">
				<li data-status="correct">TIFF</li>
				<li>JPEG / JFIF</li>
				<li>GIF</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="feedback">TIFF was the first image format, and still remains the archival standard.</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Multiple correct answers (any answer acceptable)</h2>
		<p>This type of question presumes that the question has multiple answers which might be correct - and that the learner must only identify one of them to be awarded points.</p>
<code><pre>&lt;div class="question">
	&lt;div class="prompt">3. Are you digitizing materials, or do you plan to do so in the next two years?&lt;/div>
	&lt;ul class="answers" data-questiontype="multi-radio">
		&lt;li data-status="correct">Yes&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>No&lt;/li>
		&lt;li data-status="correct">Don't know&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>Not applicable&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
	&lt;div class="feedback hidden">This is an example of a single-answer question ("radio" type) that has multiple possible correct answers. Choosing any of them results in full points being given.&lt;/div>
&lt;/div></pre></code>
		<div class="question">

		</div>
		<h2>Multiple correct answers (all required)</h2>
		<p>This type of question presumes that there are multiple correct answers - <em>all of which</em> must be selected in order to receive points.</p>
		<div class="question">
